# Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD

The algorithm is based on below facts -


*   If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.

*   Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
